// The stub writer beside an agent. It keeps the agent's place in its chain,
// asks the check before acting (guard.js) before each action, and writes a
// stub for each action that is taken. It holds the book as text; where the
// text is kept is the caller's business.
//
// It makes the two things an agent's software must do into one call, so
// that they are not forgotten: ask first, and write the receipt after.
//
// One writer serves one chain: an agent under its slip, or a helper under
// its pass. Its calls wait for one another, so two actions asked for at the
// same moment are taken one after the other, each against the book as the
// one before left it. Two writers on copies of one book know nothing of
// each other: keeping them apart is the caller's business.
//
// The writer never puts into its book a line that would make the book fail
// its check. Before an action is taken, its stub is written and checked
// with the whole book; what the other side hands back is checked before it
// joins the stub, and left out if it does not check.
//
// The book is read once, when the writer is opened, and is then carried on
// (book.js): each new line is read by itself, against what was worked out
// from the lines before it. So no signature is checked twice, and what an
// action costs grows only slowly with the length of the book. Every line
// is tried on a reader split off the book's own, which takes the book's
// place only if the line is written, and is thrown away otherwise. So the
// book's own reader always stands for exactly the text of the book,
// whatever fails on the way.
//
// What is handed to the writer is copied when it is handed over: the
// request, the approval, what the other side hands back. The copy is what
// is checked and what is written, so a later change to the caller's own
// objects changes nothing.
