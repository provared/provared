// Provared, draft version 0: proof of what an AI agent was allowed to do,
// and what it then did. Evidence, not a verdict.
//
// Checking:  checkBook, checkShow, checkSlip
//            openChecker (a checker that is carried on as the book grows)
//            checkBefore (would this action be outside the slip?)
// Beside an agent: openRecorder (ask first, act, write the stub),
//            recordTools (the agent's tools, each behind the stub writer)
// Writing:   prepareSlip + assembleSlip (the person, with a passkey),
//            prepareApproval + assembleApproval (the person's yes to one action),
//            writeStub (the agent), countersign, writeRefusal, writeTerms
//            (the service), writeSeal (whoever keeps the book), blockStampItem
//            (a proof from a public blockchain, to put beside a seal),
//            prepareCancellation + assembleCancellation (the person ends a slip),
//            writeAcknowledgement (the agent's side says it was handed a cancellation),
//            writeVouching, writeWithdrawal (an organisation vouches for a name),
//            writePass (an agent hands part of its permission to a helper agent),
//            writeBook, makeShow
// Keys:      generateKeySet, generateSealKeySet, thumbprint, keySetFingerprint
// Names:     the shared list of actions, the kinds of action, the rules of conduct
