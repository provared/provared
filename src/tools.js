// A connector between an agent's tools and the stub writer.
//
// An agent acts by calling tools: functions that its software offers it.
// recordTools puts each tool behind the stub writer (recorder.js), so that
// every call asks first, is run only if the slip allows it, and leaves a
// stub. The agent's software then calls the tools as before.
//
// By default the stub of a call names one document, "arguments": the
// fingerprint of the call's arguments. So the record fixes exactly what was
// asked for, without holding it: whoever kept the arguments can show them
// later, and anyone can work out the fingerprint again.
//
// It names no agent software and depends on none: a tool is any function.
